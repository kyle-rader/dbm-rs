# `dbm` - Database Manager

A <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> for helping manage the state of your SQL databases. Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀. Inspired by Active Record, and [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate).

Why do it? Why write another DB migration CLI? Because I wanted to learn about interacting with databases in Rust and wanted more functionality from Active Record that was missing in `dbmate`, namely the ability to separately define `seeds.sql`. (And I didn't want to learn Go 😁)
